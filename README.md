# snn_pytorch

The [Self-Normalizing Neural Network (SNN)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.02515) is implemented in this repository.
This implementation is in Pytorch while the [original SNN implementation](https://github.com/bioinf-jku/SNNs) 
is in Tensorflow.

MMIST dataset is used for the test purpose.

To run the code Pytorch and Tensorflow must be installed. Currently only CPU is used. Tensorflow is required to run tensorboard.
